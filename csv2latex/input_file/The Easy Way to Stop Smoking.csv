"1 The Worst Nicotine Addict I Have Yet to Meet","15","H1"
"It took me a long time to work it all out, basically because I was going about it back to front. I was trying to work out why it had been so easy to stop, whereas the real problem is trying to explain why smokers find it difficult to stop. Smokers talk about the terrible withdrawal pangs. but when I looked back and tried to remember those awful pangs, they didn't exist for me. There was no physical pain. It was all in the mind.","16"
"It is basically fear that keeps us smoking: the fear that life will never be quite as enjoyable without cigarettes and the fear of feeling deprived.","16"
"2 The Easy Method","17","H1"
"YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LOSE AND SO MUCH TO GAIN!","17"
"1 What is it doing for me?
2 Do I actually enjoy it?
3 Do I really need to go through life paying through the nose just to
stick these things in my mouth and suffocate myself?","18"
"3 Why is it Difficult to Stop?","19","H1"
"As I said previously, the problem is not explaining why it is easy to stop; it is explaining why it is difficult.","19"
"The usual reason why we start smoking is to show we are grown up and mature. If we had to suck a dummy in public, we would die of embarrassment.","20"
"Some think it is the reverse, the macho effect of breathing smoke or fire down your nostrils. Again this argument has no substance. A burning cigarette in the ear would appear ridiculous. How much more ridiculous to breathe cancer-triggering tars into your lungs.","20"
"Many believe smoking relieves boredom. This is also a fallacy. Boredom is a frame of mind. There is nothing interesting about a cigarette.","20"
"For thirty-three years my reason was that it relaxed me, gave me confidence and courage. I also knew it was killing me and costing me a fortune. Why didn't I go to my doctor and ask him for an alternative to relax me and give me courage and confidence? I didn't go because I knew he would suggest an alternative. It wasn't my reason; it was my excuse.","20"
"Most smokers who think about it eventually come to the conclusion that it is just a habit. This is not really an explanation but, having discounted all the usual rational explanations, it appears to be the only remaining excuse. Unfortunately, this explanation is equally illogical. Every day of our lives we change habits, and some of them are very enjoyable. We have been brainwashed to believe that smoking is a habit and that habits are difficult to break.","20"
"we are in the habit of driving on the left side of the road. Yet when we drive on the Continent or in the States, we immediately break that, habit with hardly any aggravation whatsoever. It is clearly a fallacy that habits are hard to break. The fact is that we make and break habits every day of our lives.","21"
"The answer is that smoking is not habit: IT IS NICOTINE ADDICTION! That is why it appears to be so difficult to 'give up'.","21"
"4 The Sinister Trap","22","H1"
"The truth is that the most stressful periods for any creature are early childhood and adolescence. We tend to confuse responsibility with stress.","22"
"Smokers' lives automatically become more stressful because tobacco does not relax you or relieve stress, as society tries to make you believe. Just the reverse: it actually causes you to become more nervous and stressed.","22"
"5 Why Do We Carry on Smoking?","24","H1"
"No regular smoker knows why he or she smokes. If smokers knew the true reason, they would stop doing it.","24"
"The actual reason why smokers continue to smoke is a subtle combination of the factors that I will elaborate in the next two chapters. They are:
1 NICOTINE ADDICTION
2 BRAINWASHING","24"
"6 Nicotine Addiction","25","H1"
"Nicotine, a colorless, oily compound, is the drug contained in tobacco that addicts the smoker. It is the fastest addictive drug known to mankind, and it can take just one cigarette to become hooked.","25"
"As soon as the smoker extinguishes the cigarette, the nicotine rapidly starts to leave the body and the smoker begins to suffer withdrawal pangs.","25"
"There is no physical pain in the withdrawal from nicotine. It is merely an empty, restless feeling, the feeling of something missing, which is why many smokers think it is something to do with their hands. If it is prolonged, the smoker becomes nervous, insecure, agitated, lacking in confidence and irritable. It is like hunger - for a poison, NICOTINE","25"
"You know that feeling when a neighbor’s burglar alarm has been ringing all day, or there has been some other minor, persistent aggravation. Then the noise suddenly stops - that marvelous feeling of peace and tranquility is experienced. It is not really peace but the ending of the aggravation.","6"
"The whole business of smoking is like wearing tight shoes just to obtain the pleasure you feel when you take them off.","26"
"Picture the panic state of a heroin
addict who has no heroin. Now picture the utter joy when that addict can finally plunge a
hypodermic needle into his vein. Can you visualize someone actually getting pleasure by injecting
themselves, or does the mere thought fill you with horror? Non-heroin addicts don't suffer that
panic feeling. The heroin doesn't relieve it. On the contrary, it causes it.","26"
"The main reason that smokers find it difficult to
quit is that they believe that they are giving up a genuine pleasure or crutch. It is absolutely
essential to understand that you are giving up nothing whatsoever.","26"
"Like
hunger, there is no physical pain and the feeling is so imperceptible that we are not even aware of it
between cigarettes. It's only if we want to light up and aren't allowed to do so that we become aware of
any discomfort. But when we do light up we feel satisfied.","27"
"Eating doesn't create hunger and genuinely relieves it, whereas the first cigarette starts the
craving for nicotine and each subsequent one, far from relieving it, ensures that you suffer it
for the rest of life.","27"
"The only reason any smoker lights a cigarette
is to try to end the empty, insecure feeling that the previous cigarette created.","27"
"The real reason why every smoker goes on smoking is because
of that little monster inside his stomach. Every now and again he has to feed it. The smoker himself
will decide when he does that, and it tends to he on four types of occasion or a combination of them.","28"
"BOREDOM/CONCENTRATION - two complete opposites! STRESS/RELAXATION-two
complete opposites!","28"
"The truth is that
smoking neither relieves boredom and stress nor promotes concentration and relaxation. It is all just
illusion.","28"
"What we are actually doing when we learn to smoke is teaching our bodies to become
immune to the bad smell and taste in order to get our fix, like heroin addicts who think
that they enjoy injecting themselves. The withdrawal pangs from heroin are relatively
severe, and all they are really enjoying is the ritual of relieving those pangs.","29"
"The reason why most of us carry on smoking is because, although we know the disadvantages
outweigh the advantages, we believe that there is something in the cigarette that we actually enjoy
or that it is some sort of prop. We feel that after we stop smoking there will he a void, that certain
situations in our life will never be quite the
same. This is an illusion. The fact is the cigarette gives nothing; it only takes away and then
partially restores to create the illusion.","29"
"the actual withdrawal pangs are so mild that
most smokers have lived and died without ever
realizing that they have suffered them.","29"
"You will quite rightly ask why it is that many smokers find it so difficult to stop, go through
months of torture and spend the rest of their lives pining for a cigarette at odd times. The answer is the
second reason why we smoke - the brainwashing. The chemical addiction is easy to cope with.","29"
"Most smokers go all night without a cigarette. The withdrawal pangs do not even wake them up.","29"
"Many smokers will actually leave the bedroom before they light that first cigarette; many will have
breakfast first; many will wait until they arrive at work. They can suffer ten hours' withdrawal
pangs, and it doesn't bother them, but if they went ten hours during the day without a cigarette,
they'd be tearing their hair out.","29"
"If you stop now, your body will recover within a matter of a few
weeks, almost as if you had never been a smoker.","30"
"7 Brainwashing and the Sleeping Partner","31","H1"
"The main delusion of
smokers is that smoking relieves stress and tends to be associated with the dominant type, the type
that takes on responsibility and stress, and, of course, that is the type that we admire and
therefore tend to copy.","32"
"Why am I doing it?
Do I really need to?
NO, OF COURSE YOU DON'T.","33"
"no one appears more contented than pipe smokers.
Most of them are convinced that they smoke because they enjoy the pipe. But why did they have to
work so hard to learn to like it when they were perfectly happy without it?","34"
"The answer is that once you have become addicted to nicotine, the brainwashing is increased. Your
subconscious mind knows that the little monster has to be fed, and you block everything else from your
mind.","34"
"It is the brainwashing that is the main difficulty in giving up smoking. The brainwashing of our
upbringing in society reinforced with the brainwashing from our own addiction and, most
powerful of all, the brainwashing of our friends, relatives and colleagues.","34"
"Did you notice that up to now I've frequently referred to 'giving up' smoking, I used the
expression at the beginning of the previous paragraph. This is a classic example of the brainwashing.
The expression implies a genuine sacrifice. The beautiful truth is that there is absolutely nothing to
give up. On the contrary, you will be freeing yourself from a terrible disease and achieving marvelous
positive gains.","34"
"From this point on, no longer
will we refer to 'giving up', but to stopping, quitting or the true position: ESCAPING!","34"
"The only thing that persuades us to smoke in the first place is all the other people doing it. We feel
we are missing out. We work so hard to become hooked, yet nobody ever finds out what they have
been missing.","34"
"This brainwashing is very powerful and you need to be aware of its effects.","34"
"We are about to remove the brainwashing. It is not the non-smoker who is being deprived but the
poor smoker who is forfeiting a lifetime of:
HEALTH
ENERGY
WEALTH
PEACE OF MIND
CONFIDENCE
COURAGE
SELF-RESPECT
HAPPINESS
FREEDOM.
And what does he gain from these considerable sacrifices?
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING-except the illusion of trying to get back to the state of peace,
tranquility and confidence that the non-smoker enjoys all the time.","35"
"8 Relieving Withdrawal Pangs","36","H1"
"As already stated, smokers tend to relieve their withdrawal pangs at times of stress, boredom,
concentration, relaxation or a combination of these.","36"
"9 Stress","37","H1"
"I am referring not only to the great tragedies of life but also to the minor stresses, the socializing,
the telephone call, the anxieties of the housewife with noisy young children and so on.","37"
"For most people the telephone is slightly
stressful, particularly for the business man. Most calls aren't from satisfied customers or your
boss congratulating you. There's usually some sort of aggro - something going wrong or somebody
making demands. At that time the smoker, if he isn't already doing so, will light up a cigarette. He
doesn't know why he does this, but he does know that for some reason it appears to help.","37"
"What has actually happened is this. Without being conscious of it, he has already been suffering
aggravation (i.e. the withdrawal pangs). By partially relieving that aggravation at the same time as
normal stress, the total stress is reduced and the smoker gets a boost. At this point the boost is not, in
fact, an illusion. The smoker will feel better than before he lit the cigarette. However, even when
smoking that cigarette the smoker is more tense than if he were a non-smoker because the more you
go into the drug, the more it knocks you down and the less it restores you when you smoke.","37"
"As you go through life it
systematically takes away your nerve and courage. The more it takes your courage away, the more you
are deluded into believing the cigarette is doing the opposite.","37"
"Get it clear in your head that the cigarette is not relieving your nerves; it is slowly but steadily
destroying them. One of the great gains of breaking the habit is the return of your confidence and
self-assurance.","37"
"10 Boredom","38","H1"
"Another fallacy about smoking is that cigarettes relieve boredom. Boredom is a frame of mind.
When you smoke a cigarette your mind isn't saying, 'I'm smoking a cigarette. I'm smoking a cigarette.'
The only time that happens is when you have been deprived for a long time or are trying to cut down, or
during those first few cigarettes after a failed attempt to stop.","38"
"when you are addicted to nicotine and are not smoking, there is something
missing. If you have something to occupy your mind that isn't stressful, you can go for long periods
without being bothered by the absence of the drug. However, when you are bored there's nothing to take
your mind off it. so you feed the monster.","38"
"The truth is that cigarettes tend to increase boredom indirectly because they make you feel
lethargic, and instead of undertaking some energetic activity smokers tend to lounge around, bored,
relieving their withdrawal pangs.","38"
"Next time you watch someone chewing gum,
observe them closely and ask yourself whether they looked relaxed or tense. Observe smokers who
are smoking because they are bored. They still looked bored. The cigarette doesn't relieve the
boredom.","38"
"11 Concentration","39","H1"
"When you are trying to concentrate, you automatically try to avoid distractions like feeling cold
or hot. The smoker is already suffering: that little monster wants his fix. So when he wants to
concentrate he doesn't even have to think about it. He automatically lights up, partially ending the
craving, gets on with the matter in hand and has already forgotten that he is smoking.","39"
"Cigarettes do not help concentration. They help to ruin it because after a while, even while
smoking a cigarette, the smoker's withdrawal pangs cease to be completely relieved. The smoker
then increases his intake, and the problem then increases.","39"
"The progressive blocking up of the
arteries and veins with poisons starves the brain of oxygen. In fact, your concentration and
inspiration will be greatly improved as this process is reversed.","39"
"The loss of concentration that smokers suffer when they try to stop smoking is not, in fact, due to
the physical withdrawal from nicotine. When you are a smoker, you have mental blocks. When you
have one, what do you do? If you are not already smoking one, you light a cigarette.","39"
"The moment you stop smoking, everything that
goes wrong in your life is blamed on the fact that you've stopped smoking. Now when you have a
mental block, instead of just getting on with it you start to say, 'If only I could light up now, it would
solve my problem.' You then start to question your decision to quit smoking.","39"
"12 Relaxations","40","H1"
"Most smokers think that a cigarette helps to relax them. The truth is that nicotine is a chemical
stimulant. If you take your pulse and then smoke two consecutive cigarettes, there will be a marked
increase in your pulse rate.","40"
"One of the favorite cigarettes for most smokers is the one after a meal. A meal is a time of day
when we stop working; we sit down and relax, relieve our hunger and thirst and are then completely
satisfied. However, the poor smoker cannot relax, as he has another hunger to satisfy. He thinks of
the cigarette as the icing on the cake, but it is the little monster that needs feeding.","40"
"The truth is that the nicotine addict can never be completely relaxed, and as you go through life it
gets worse,","40"
"The most unrelaxed people on this planet aren't non-smokers but fifty-year-old business executives
who chain-smoke, are permanently coughing and spluttering, have high blood pressure and are
constantly irritable. At this point cigarettes cease to relieve even partially the symptoms that they
have created.","40"
"During those times I thought I had all the problems in the world, hut when I look back on my
life I wonder where all the great stress was.","40"
"You' ll find that they have their hands near their mouths, or they are twiddling
their thumbs, or tapping their feet, or fiddling with their hair, or clenching their jaw, Smokers
aren't relaxed. They've forgotten what it feels like to be completely relaxed. That's one of the
many joys you have to come.","40"
"13 Combination Cigarettes","41","H1"
"A combination cigarette is one occasioned by two or more of our usual reasons for smoking, e.g.
social functions, parties, weddings, meals in restaurants. These are examples of occasions that are
both stressful and relaxing.","41"
"Another classic example is a game of cards. If it's a game like bridge or poker, you have to
concentrate. If you are losing more than you can afford, it is stressful. If you have long periods of not
getting a decent hand, it can be boring. And, while all this is going on, you are at leisure; you are
supposed to be relaxing. During a game of cards, no matter how slight the withdrawal pangs are, all
smokers will be chain-smoking, even otherwise casual smokers. The ashtrays will fill and overflow in
no time.","41"
"These combination cigarettes are often special ones, the ones that we think we'll miss most when
we are contemplating stopping smoking.","41"
"Let us make it quite clear. It is not the cigarette that is special; it is the occasion. Once we have
removed the need for the cigarette, such occasions will become more enjoyable and the stressful
situations less stressful.","41"
"14 What am I Giving Up?","42","H1"
"ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! The thing that makes it difficult for us to give up is fear. The fear that
we are being deprived of our pleasure or prop. The fear that certain pleasant situations will never be
quite the same again. The fear of being unable to cope with stressful situations.
In other words, the effect of brainwashing is to delude us into believing that there is a weakness in us,
or something inherent in the cigarette that we need, and that when we stop smoking there will be a
void.","42"
"Get it clear in your mind: CIGARETTES DO NOT FILL A VOID. THEY CREATE IT!","42"
"The beautiful truth is - there is nothing to give up. Once you purge that little monster from your
body and the brainwashing from your mind, you will neither want cigarettes nor need them.","42"
"Cigarettes do not improve meals. They ruin them. They destroy your sense of taste and smell.","42"
"Smokers do not smoke because they enjoy it. They do it because they are
miserable without it.","42"
"Because many of us start smoking on social occasions when we are young and shy, we acquire the
belief that we cannot enjoy social occasions without a cigarette. This is nonsense. Tobacco takes
away your confidence. The greatest evidence of the fear that cigarettes instill in smokers is their
effect on women.","42"
"Cigarettes do not help social occasions; they destroy them.","42"
"These
are obviously valid and important issues, but I personally believe the greatest gains from stopping
are psychological, and for varying reasons they include:
1 The return of your confidence and courage.
2 Freedom from the slavery.
3 Not to have to go through life suffering the awful black shadows at
the back of your mind, knowing you are being despised by half
of the population and, worst of all. despising yourself,","43"
"It was as if a great mist had suddenly lifted from my mind. I could see so clearly that that panic
feeling of wanting a cigarette wasn't some sort of weakness in me, or some magic quality in the
cigarette. It was caused by the first cigarette; and each subsequent one, far from relieving the
feeling, was causing it.","44"
"IT'S SO NICE TO BE FREE!","44"
"15 Self-imposed Slavery","45","H1"
"With most of the cigarettes we smoke in our lives, not
only do we not enjoy them but we aren't even aware that we are smoking them. It is only after a
period of abstinence that we actually suffer the delusion of enjoying a cigarette","45"
"We were not designed to go through life
systematically poisoning our own bodies. The pathetic thing is that even when smoking a cigarette, the
smoker doesn't achieve the feeling of peace, confidence and tranquility that the non-smoker has
experienced for the whole of his non-smoking life.","45"
"To me one of the tremendous joys of being a non-smoker is to be freed from that slavery, to be able to
enjoy the whole of my life and not spend half of it craving for a cigarette and then, when I light up,
wishing I didn't have to do it.","46"
"Smokers should bear in mind that when they are in the houses of non-smokers or even in the
company of non-smokers, it is not the self-righteous non-smoker who is depriving them but the
'little monster'.","46"
"17 Health","49","H1"
"I had been doing what every smoker does all his
smoking life: closing my mind and keeping my head in the sand, hoping that I would wake up one
morning and just not want to smoke any more. Smokers cannot allow themselves to think of the
health risks. If they do, even the illusion of enjoying the 'habit' goes.","49"
"The cough itself is not a disease; it is just a symptom. When smokers cough it is because their lungs
are trying to dispel cancer-triggering tars and poisons. When they do not cough those tars and
poisons remain in their lungs, and that is when they cause cancer.","50"
"Wise up. You don't have to do it, and remember: it is doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR
YOU.","50"
"Stop kidding yourself. You have the chance. It's a chain reaction. If you smoke the next cigarette,
it will lead to the next one and the next. It's already happening to you.","50"
"Smokers tend to think of the health hazard as a hit-and-miss affair, like stepping on a mine. Get it
into your head: it is already happening, Every time you puff on a cigarette you are breathing cancer
triggering tars into your lungs, and cancer is by no means the worst of the killer diseases that
cigarettes cause or contribute to. They are also a powerful contributory cause of heart disease,
arteriosclerosis, emphysema, angina, thrombosis, chronic bronchitis and asthma.","50"
"The fear of contracting lung cancer didn't make me quit because I believed it was rather like
walking through a minefield. If you got away with it - fine. If you were unlucky you stepped on a mine.
You knew the risks you were taking and if you were prepared to take the risk, what had it to do with
anyone else?","51"
"As you are already aware, my
method is not to frighten you into quitting, but the complete opposite - to make you realize just
how more enjoyable your life will be when you have escaped.","52"
"However, I do believe that if I could have seen what was happening inside my body, this would
have helped me to quit. Now I'm not referring to the shock technique of showing a smoker the
color of a smoker's lungs. It was obvious to me from my nicotine-stained teeth and fingers that
my lungs weren't a pretty sight. Provided they kept functioning, they were less embarrassment
than my teeth and fingers - at least nobody could see my lungs.","52"
"What I am referring to is the progressive gunging-up of our arteries and veins and the gradual
starving of every muscle and organ of our bodies of oxygen and nutrients and replacing them
with poisons and carbon monoxide (not just from car exhausts but also from smoking)","52"
"One of the great evils about smoking is that it fools us into believing that nicotine gives us
courage, when in fact it gradually and imperceptibly dissipates it. I was shocked when I heard my
father say that he had no wish to live to be fifty. Little did I realize that twenty years later I would
have exactly the same lack of joie de vivre.","53"
"I promise you it is the complete opposite. I used to
fear death when I was a child. I used to believe that smoking removed that fear. Perhaps it did. If so,
it replaced it with something infinitely worse: A FEAR OF LIVING I","53"
"I used to have repetitive nightmares every night. I would dream that!
was being chased. I can only assume that these nightmares were the result of the body being
deprived of nicotine throughout the night and the insecure feeling that would result. Now the only
nightmare that I have is that I occasionally dream that I am smoking again. This is quite a common
dream among ex-smokers.","54"
"The effect of the brainwashing is that we tend to think like the man who, having fallen off a 100-
storey building, is heard to say, as he passes the fiftieth floor, 'So far, so good!' We think that as we
have got away with it so far, one more cigarette won't make the difference.","54"
"Try to see it another way, the 'habit' is a continuous chain for life, each cigarette creating the
need for the next. When you start the habit you light a fuse. The trouble is, YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG THE FUSE IS. Every time that you light a cigarette you are one step nearer to the
bomb exploding. HOW WILL YOU KNOW IF IT'S THE NEXT ONE?","54"
"18 Energy","55","H1"
"If I could immediately transfer you into your mind and body to give you a
direct comparison on how you would feel having stopped smoking for just three weeks, that is all I
would need to do to persuade you to quit. You would think: 'Will I really feel this good?' Or what it
really amounts to: 'Have I really sunk that low?'","55"
"The problem is that when you quit smoking, the return of your physical and mental health is also
gradual. True it's nothing like as slow as the slide into the pit, and if you are going through the
trauma of the willpower method of quitting, any health or financial gains will be obliterated by the
depression you will be going through.","55"
"Unfortunately, I cannot immediately transfer you into your mind and body in three weeks' time.
But you can! You know instinctively that what I am telling you is correct. All you need to do is:
USE YOUR IMAGINATION!","55"
"19 It Relaxes Me and Gives Me Confidence","56","H1"
"Smokers find it very difficult to believe that the cigarette actually causes that insecure feeling you
get when you are out late at night and running out of cigarettes. Non-smokers do not suffer from that
feeling. It is the tobacco that causes it.","56"
"None of these things did I relate to my smoking 'habit', but getting off it has been like awakening
from a bad dream. Nowadays I look forward to each day. Of course, bad things happen in my life,
and I am subject to the normal stresses and strains, but it is wonderful to have the confidence to
cope with them, and extra health, energy and confidence make the good times more enjoyable too.","56"
"20 Those Sinister Black Shadows","57","H1","H1"
"All smokers know they are mugs and close their minds to the ill-effects of smoking. For most of our
lives smoking is automatic, but the black shadows are always lurking in our subconscious minds, just
beneath the surface.","57"
"But now that I am free it amazes
me how 1 successfully blocked my mind from even more important advantages to be gained from
quitting.","57"
"But for me the greatest joy of being free was not the health, the money, the
energy, or the ending of the slavery, it was the removal of those sinister black shadows, the removal
of feeling despised by and feeling apologetic to non-smokers, and most of all to be able to respect
yourself.","57"
"21 The Advantages of Being a Smoker","58","H1"
"22 The Willpower Method of Stopping","60","H1"
"It is an accepted fact in our society that it is very difficult to stop smoking. Even books advising
you how to do so usually start off by telling you how difficult it is. The truth is that it is ridiculously
easy. Yes, I can understand your questioning that statement, but just consider it.","60"
"However, in order to stop smoking all you have to do is not smoke any more. No one forces you to
smoke (apart from yourself) and, unlike food or drink, you don't need it to survive. So if you want to
stop doing it, why should it be difficult? In fact, it isn't. It is smokers who make it difficult by
using the Willpower Method. I define the Willpower Method as any method that forces the smoker to
feel he is making some sort of sacrifice.","60"
"In fact smoking
neither improves meals and social occasions nor does it relieve stress, it's just that smokers
believe they can't enjoy a meal or handle stress without a cigarette.","60"
"It usually takes us a long time to realize that we are hooked because we suffer from the illusion
that smokers smoke because they enjoy a cigarette, not because they have to have a cigarette. While
we are not enjoying them (which we never do), we suffer from the illusion that we can stop whenever
we want to.","60"
"Usually it is not until we actually try to stop that we realize a problem exists.","60"
"Whatever the reason, the smoker
always waits for a stressful situation, whether it be health or money. As soon as he stops, the little
monster needs feeding. The smoker then wants a cigarette, and because he cannot have one this
makes him more distressed. The thing he usually takes to relieve stress is now not available, so he
suffers a triple blow.","60"
"Of course, the time is never right because life for most people doesn't become less stressful; it
becomes more so. We leave the protection of our parents and enter the world of setting up home,
taking on mortgages, having children, more responsible jobs, etc. Of course, the smoker's life can
never become less stressful because it is the cigarette that actually causes stress. As the smoker's
rate of nicotine intake rises, the more distressed he becomes and the greater the illusion of his
dependency becomes.","60"
"In fact, it is an illusion that life becomes more stressful, and it's the smoking itself, or a similar
crutch, that creates the illusion.","61"
"Let's consider in greater detail why the Willpower Method is so difficult.","61"
"At odd times something will trigger off an attempt to stop. It may be concern about health, money,
social stigma or we may have been going through a particularly heavy bout of choking and realize
that we don't actually enjoy it.","61"
"Whatever the reason, we take our head out of the sand and start weighing up the pros and cons of
smoking. We then find out what we have known all our lives: on a rational assessment the
conclusion is, a dozen times over, STOP SMOKING.","61"
"The smoker doesn't
know why, but he believes that during the good times and the bad times of life the cigarette does
appear to help.","61"
"Let's assume that the smoker survives a few days without a cigarette. The congestion is rapidly
disappearing from his lungs. He hasn't bought cigarettes and consequently has more money in his
pocket. So the reasons why he decided to stop in the first place are rapidly disappearing from his
thoughts. It is like seeing a bad road accident when you are driving. It slows you down for a while,
but the next time you are late for an appointment you have forgotten all about it and your foot stamps
on the throttle.","62"
"On the other side of the tug of war, that little monster inside your stomach hasn't had his fix. There
is no physical pain; if you had the same feeling because of a cold, you wouldn't stop working or get
depressed. You would laugh it off. All the smoker knows is that he wants a cigarette. Quite why it is
so important to him he doesn't know. The little monster in the stomach then starts off the big monster
in the mind, and now the person who a few hours or days earlier was listing all the reasons to stop
is desperately searching for any excuse to start again. Now he is saying things like:
1 Life is too short. The bomb could go off, I could step under a bus tomorrow. I have left it too
late. They tell you everything gives youcancer these days.
2 I have picked the wrong time. I should have waited until after Christmas/after my
holidays/after this stressful event, in my life. 1 cannot concentrate, I am getting irritable and
bad tempered. I cannot do my job properly. My family and friends won't love me. Let's face it,
for everybody's sake I have got to start smoking again. I am a confirmed smoker and there is no
way I will ever be happyagain without a cigarette. (This one kept me smoking for thirty
three years.)","62"
"At this stage the smoker usually gives in. He lights a cigarette and the schizophrenia increases.
On the one hand there is the tremendous relief of ending the craving, when the little monster finally
gets his fix; on the other hand, if he has survived a long time, the cigarette tastes awful and the
smoker cannot understand why he is smoking it. This is why the smoker thinks he lacks willpower.
In fact, it is not lack of willpower; all he has done is to change his mind and make a perfectly-rational
decision in the light of the latest information.","62"
"Fortunately, that is not true - just the reverse. Life as a non-smoker is infinitely more enjoyable,
but it was this delusion that kept me smoking for thirty-three years, and I must confess, if that were the
true situation. I would still be smoking (correction -I wouldn't be here).","62"
"The misery that the smoker is suffering has nothing to do with withdrawal pangs. True, they trigger
them off, but the actual agony is in the mind and it is caused by doubt and uncertainty.","62"
"Another thing that makes it so difficult is the waiting for something to happen. If your object is to
pass a driving test, as soon as you have passed the test it is certain you have achieved your object.
Under the Willpower Method you say, 'If I can go long enough without a cigarette, the urge to smoke
will eventually go.'","62"
"How do you know when you have achieved it? The answer is that you never do because you are
waiting for something to happen and nothing else is going to happen. You stopped when you smoked
that last cigarette, and what you are really doing now is waiting to see how long it will be before you
give in.","63"
"There can be days or even weeks of black depression. His mind is obsessed with doubts and fears.
'How long will the craving last?'
'Will I ever be happy again?'
'Will 1 ever want to get up in the morning?'
'Will I ever enjoy a meal again?'
'How will I ever cope with stress in future?'
'Will I ever enjoy a social function again?'
The smoker is waiting for things to improve, but of course while he is still moping, the cigarette is
becoming more precious.","63"
"In fact, something does happen, but the smoker isn't conscious of it. If he can survive three weeks
without inhaling any nicotine at all, the physical craving for nicotine disappears. However, as
stated before, the pangs of withdrawal from nicotine are so mild that the smoker isn't aware of them.
But after about three weeks many smokers sense that they have 'kicked it'. They then light a
cigarette to prove it, and it does just that. It tastes awful, but the ex-smoker has now supplied nicotine
to the body, and as soon as he extinguishes that cigarette the nicotine starts to leave the body.
There is now a little voice at the back of his mind saying, 'You want another one.' In fact, he had
kicked it but now he has hooked himself again.","63"
"Smokers who succeed under the Willpower Method tend to find it long and difficult because the
main problem is the brainwashing, and long after the physical addiction has died the smoker is
still moping about cigarettes. Eventually, if he can survive long enough, it begins to dawn on him that
he is not going to give in. He stops moping and accepts that life goes on and is enjoyable without the
cigarette.","63"
"Many smokers are succeeding with this method, but it is difficult and arduous, and there are many
more failures than successes. Even those who do succeed go through the rest of their lives in a
vulnerable state. They are left with a certain amount of the brainwashing and believe that during
good and bad times the cigarette can give you a boost.","63"
"Many ex-smokers will have the occasional cigar or cigarette either as a 'special treat' or to convince
themselves how awful they are. It does exactly that, but as soon as they put it out the nicotine starts
to leave and a little voice at the back of their mind is saying, 'You want another one.' If they light,
another one, it still tastes awful and they say, 'Marvelous! While I am not enjoying them I won't get
hooked. After Christmas/ the holiday/this trauma, I will stop,'
Too late. They are already hooked. The trap that they fell into in the first place has claimed its
victim again.","64"
"As I keep saying, enjoyment doesn't come into it. It never did! If we smoked because we enjoyed it,
nobody would ever smoke more than one cigarette.","64"
"23 Beware of Cutting Down","65","H1"
"Many smokers resort to cutting down either as a stepping-stone towards stopping or as an attempt to
control the little monster,","65"
"Obviously, the less you smoke the better off you are, but, as a stepping-stone to stopping, cutting
down is fatal. It is our attempts to cut down that keep us trapped all our lives.","65"
"Usually cutting down follows failed attempts to stop. After a few hours or days of abstinence the
smoker says to himself something like, 'I cannot face the thought of being without a cigarette, so from
now on I will just smoke the special ones or I will cut down to ten a day. If I can get in the habit of
smoking ten a day, I can either hold it there or cut down further.'
Certain terrible things now happen,
1 He has the worst of all worlds. He is still addicted to nicotine and is keeping the monster alive
not only in his body but also in his mind.
2 He is now wishing his life away waiting for the next cigarette.
3 Prior to cutting down, whenever he wanted a cigarette he lit one up and at least partially
relieved his withdrawal pangs. Now, in addition to the normal stresses and strains of life, he
is actually causing himself to suffer the withdrawal pangs from nicotine most of his life. So he is
causing himself to be miserable and bad tempered,
4 While he was indulging himself, he didn't enjoy most of the cigarettes and he didn't realize he
was smoking them. It was automatic. The only cigarettes that he imagined he enjoyed were after a
period of abstinence (e.g. the first in the morning, the one after a meal, etc,).","65"
"Now that he waits an extra hour for each cigarette, he 'enjoys' every one. The longer he waits, the
more enjoyable each cigarette appears to become because the 'enjoyment' in a cigarette isn't the
cigarette itself; it's the ending of the agitation caused by the craving, whether it be the slight physical
craving for nicotine or the mental moping. The longer you suffer, the more 'enjoyable' each cigarette
becomes.","65"
"In fact, smokers get a
secret pleasure out of going long periods without a cigarette. It gives them the hope that maybe one
day they will never want another one.","65"
"There is nothing more pathetic than the smoker who is trying to cut down. He suffers from the
delusion that the less he smokes, the less he will want to smoke. In fact, the reverse is true. The less
he smokes, the longer he suffers the withdrawal pangs; the more he enjoys the cigarette, the more
distasteful they become.","66"
"It is essential that we remove all the illusions about smoking before you extinguish that final
cigarette. Unless you've removed the illusionthat you enjoy the taste of certain cigarettes before you
extinguish the final one, there is no way you can prove it afterwards without getting hooked again.","66"
"The reason smokers believe that cigarettes taste better after a meal or at social
occasions with alcohol, is because those are the times when both non-smokers and smokers are
really happy, but a nicotine addict can never be really happy if that little nicotine monster remains
unsatisfied.","66"
"Cutting down not only doesn't work but it is the worst form of torture.","66"
"Therefore in order to cut down, the smoker has to exercise
willpower and discipline for the rest of his life.","66"
"I have heard of literally thousands of cases in which cutting down has failed. The handful of
successes 1 have known have been achieved after a relatively short period of cutting down, followed
by the 'cold turkey'. The smokers really stopped in spite of cutting down, not because of it. All it did
was prolong the agony.","67"
"So the choice is:
1 Cut down for life. This will be self-imposed torture, and you will not be able to do it anyway.
2 Increasingly choke yourself for life. What is the point?
3 Be nice to yourself. Stop doing it.
The other important point that cutting down demonstrates is that there is no such thing as the
odd or occasional cigarette. Smoking is a chain reaction that will last the rest of your life unless you
make a positive effort to break it,
REMEMBER: CUTTING DOWN WILL DRAG YOU DOWN.","67"
"24 Just One Cigarette","68","H1"
"'Just one cigarette' is a myth you must get out of your mind.","68"
"Get it firmly in your mind there is no such thing as just one cigarette. It is a chain reaction that will
last the rest of your life unless you break it.","68"
"It is the myth about the odd, special cigarette that keeps smokers moping about it when they stop.
Get into the habit of never seeing the odd cigarette or packet - it is a fantasy. Whenever you think
about smoking, see a whole filthy lifetime of spending a small fortune just for the privilege of
destroying yourself mentally and physically, a lifetime of slavery, a lifetime of bad breath.","68"
"It is a pity that there isn't something like a cigarette that, during good and bad times, we can use for
an occasional boost or pleasure. But get it clearly into your mind: the cigarette isn't it. You are stuck
with either a lifetime of misery or none at all. You wouldn't dream of taking cyanide because you liked
the taste of almonds, so stop punishing yourself with the thought of the occasional cigarette or cigar.","68"
"every smoker
has that choice every day of his life. Why doesn't he opt for it? The answer is fear. The fear that he
cannot stop or that life won't be the same without it.
Stop kidding yourself. You can do it. Anybody can. It's ridiculously easy.
In order to make it easy to stop smoking there are certain fundamentals to get clear in your
mind. We have already dealt with three of them up to now:","68"
"1 There is nothing to give up. There are only marvelous positive gains to achieve.
2 Never see the odd cigarette. It doesn't exist. There is only a lifetime of filth and disease,
3 There is nothing different about you. Any smoker can find it easy to stop.","68"
"Many smokers believe that they are confirmed smokers or have addictive personalities. I
promise you there is no such thing. No one needs to smoke before they become hooked on the
drug. It is the drug that hooks you and not the nature of your character or personality. That is the
effect of these drugs, they make you believe that you have an addictive personality.","68"
"25 Casual Smokers, Teenagers, Non-smokers","69","H1"
"* No smoker ever decided to become a smoker casual or otherwise,
therefore:
* All smokers feel stupid, therefore:
* All smokers have to lie to themselves and other people in a vain
attempt to justify their stupidity.","69"
"Why do smokers brag about how little they smoke? If that's the true criterion, then surely the true
accolade is not to smoke at all.
If I said to you, 'Do you know, I can go all week without carrots and it doesn't bother me in the
slightest,' You would think I was some sort of nutcase. If I enjoy carrots, why would I want go all
week without them? If I didn't enjoy them, why would I make such a statement?","69"
"There are three main factors that prevent smokers from chain-smoking.
1 MONEY, Most cannot afford to.
2 HEALTH. In order to relieve our withdrawal pangs, we have to take a poison. Capacity to
cope with that poison varies with each individual and at different times and situations in his or
her life. This acts as an automatic restraint.
3 DISCIPLINE. This is imposed by society, or the smoker's job, or friends and relatives, or by
the smoker himself as a result of the natural tug of war that goes on in every smoker's mind.","69"
"I knew I was a very strong-willed person. It never occurred to me
that most smokers are incapable of chain-smoking, you need very strong lungs in order to do it. Some
of these five-a-day smokers that heavy smokers tend to envy smoke five a day because physically
their constitution cannot smoke more, or because they cannot afford to smoke more, or because their
job, or society, or their own hatred of being hooked won't allow them to smoke more.","69"
"THECASUAL SMOKER There are two basic classifications of casual smokers.
1 The smoker who has fallen for the trap but doesn't realize it. Do not envy such smokers. They are
merely sampling the nectar at the mouth of the pitcher plant and in al I probability will soon be
heavy smokers. Remember, just as all alcoholics started off as casual drinkers, so all smokers
started off as casual smokers.
2 The smoker who was previously a heavy smoker and thinks he cannot stop. These smokers
are the most pathetic of all. They fall into various categories, each of which needs separate
comment.","70"
"THE SIX-MONTHS-OX, S1X-MONTHS-OFF SMOKER. (Or 'I can stop whenever I want to. I have done it
thousands of times,') If he enjoys smoking, why does he stop for six months? If he does not enjoy
it, why does he start again? The truth is he is still hooked. Although he gets rid of the physical
addiction, he is left with the main problem - the brainwashing.","70"
"They get the worst of all
worlds. When they are smokers they wish they weren't; when they are non-smokers they wish they
could smoke.","70"
"Cigarettes themselves are filth and poison. This is why you only suffer the illusion
of enjoying them after a period of abstinence. Just like a hunger or thirst, the longer you suffer it,
the greater the pleasure when you finally relieve it.","71"
"Smoking is drug
addiction. The natural tendency is to relieve withdrawal pangs, not to endure them. Even to hold it
at the level you are already at, you would have to exercise willpower and discipline for the rest of your
life because, as your body becomes immune to the drug, it wants more and more, not less and less.","71"
"If you think this couldn't
happen to you, STOP KIDDING YOURSELF.
IT IS ALREADY HAPPENING.","72"
"I have given much
thought to this problem and have written a book (Penguin) designed specifically to address the
problem of how to prevent your children from becoming hooked and how to help them escape if they
have already done so.","73"
"27 A Social Habit?","76","H1"
"Today the position is completely reversed. Today's strong man doesn't need to smoke. Today's strong
man is not dependent on a drug.","76"
"With the social revolution all smokers nowadays are giving serious thought to stopping, and
today's smokers are considered to be generally weak people,","76"
"Many smokers won't smoke between courses now because they feel so self-conscious. Many not only
apologize to people on the same table but also look around to see if they'll get flak from elsewhere. As
every day more and more smokers leave the sinking ship, so those left on it become terrified they'll be
the last.
DON'T LET IT BE YOU!","76"
"28Timing","77","H1"
"Apart from the obvious point that as it is doing you no good, now is the right time to stop, I believe
timing is important. Our society treats smoking flippantly as a slightly distasteful habit that can
injure your health. It is not. It is drug addiction, a disease and the No. 1 killer in society.","77"
"While you are smoking that last cigarette, be conscious
of the bad smell and taste and think how marvelous it will be when you allow yourself to stop doing
it.","77"
"WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T FALL INTO THE TRAP OF JUST SAYING, 'NOT NOW.
LATER,' AND PUTTING IT OUT OF YOUR MIND. WORK OUT YOUR TIMETABLE NOW
AND LOOK FORWARD TO IT.","77"
"This may sound like a contradiction, but I know what the man meant. We think of stopping smoking
as something that is very difficult to do. What do we need when we have something difficult to do?
We need our little friend. So stopping smoking appears to be a double blow. Not only do we have a
difficult task to perform, which is hard enough, hut the crutch on which we normally rely on such
occasions is no longer available.
It didn't occur to me until long after the man had left that my instruction to keep smoking is the real
beauty of my method. You can continue to smoke while you go through the process of stopping. You
get rid of all your doubts and fears first, and when you extinguish that final cigarette you are already a
non-smoker and enjoying being one.","78"
"In fact, that isn't the
easiest way to do it. The easiest way is to pick what you consider to be the most difficult time to do
it, whether it be stress, social, concentration or boredom. Once you've proved that you can cope with,
and enjoy, life in the worst possible situation, every other situation becomes easy. But if I gave that as a
definite instruction, would you even make the attempt to stop?","78"
"The
Richard Burtons of this world are physically and mentally strong. What destroys them is not the
stresses of life, or their jobs, or old age but the so-called crutches they turn to, which are just
illusions. Sadly, in his case and for millions like him, the crutche s kill.","79"
"Look at it this way. You've already decided that you are not going to stay in the trap the rest of
your life. Therefore at some time in your life, whether you find it easy or difficult, you will have
to go through the process of getting free. Smoking is not a habit or pleasure. It is drug addiction
and a disease. We've already established that, far from being easier to stop tomorrow, it will get
progressively harder. With a disease that's going to get progressively worse, the time to get rid of
it is NOW","79"
"Just think how quickly each week of our lives
comes and goes. That's all it takes. Just think how nice it will he to enjoy the rest of your life
without that ever-increasing black shadow hanging over you. And if you follow all my
instructions, you won't even have to wait five days. You won't only find it easy after
extinguishing the final cigarette: YOU'LL ENJOY IT!","79"
"29 Will I Miss the Cigarette?","80","H1"
"No! Once that little nicotine monster is dead and your body stops craving nicotine, any remaining
brainwashing will vanish and you will find that you will be both physically and mentally better
equipped not only to cope with the stresses and strains of life but to enjoy the good times to the
full.","80"
"There is only one danger and that is the influence of people who are still smoking. 'The other man's
grass is always greener' is commonplace in many aspects of our lives and is easily understandable.","80"
"It is the influence of smokers.","80"
"It usually happens on social occasions, particularly after a meal. The smoker lights up and the ex
smoker has a pang. This is indeed a curious anomaly, particularly if you consider this piece of market
research: not only is every non-smoker in the world happy to he a non-smoker but every smoker in
the world, even with his warped, addicted, brainwashed mind suffering the delusion that he enjoys it
or it relaxes him, wishes he had never become hooked in the first place. So why do some ex-smokers
envy the smoker on these occasions? There are two reasons.","80"
"1 'Just one cigarette.' Remember; it doesn't exist. Stop seeing that isolated occasion and start
looking at it from the point of view of the smoker. You may be envying him, but he doesn't
approve of himself: He envies you. Start observing other smokers. They can be the most powerful
boost of all to help you of it.","80"
"Remember, he is not enjoying it;
it's just that he cannot enjoy himself without it. Particularly remember that when he leaves
your company he is going to have to go on smoking. The next morning, when he wakes up
with a chest like a cesspit, he is going to have to carry on choking himself.","80"
"he has to
continue this lifetime chain of paying through the nose just for the privilege of destroying
himself physically and mentally. He is facing a lifetime of filth, bad breath, stained teeth, a
lifetime of slavery, a lifetime of destroying himself, a lifetime of black shadows at the back of
his mind. And all of this is to achieve what purpose? The illusion of trying to get back to the
state he was in before he became hooked in the first place.","80"
"2 The second reason why some ex-smokers have pangs on these occasions is because the
smoker is doing something, i.e. smoking a cigarette, and the non-smoker is not, so he tends
to feel deprived. Get it clear in your mind before you start: it is not the non-smoker who is
being deprived. It is the poor smoker who is being deprived of","80"

"Get out of the habit of envying smokers and start seeing them as the miserable, pathetic
creatures they really are. I know: I was the world's worst. That is why you are reading this book,

of all.","81"

"30 Will I Put on Weight?","82","H1"
"Once that little monster leaves your body, the awful feeling of insecurity ends. Your confidence
returns, together with a marvelous feeling of self-respect. You obtain the assurance to take control
of your life, not only in your eating habits but also in all other ways. This is one of the many
great advantages of being free from the weed.","82"

Why do I need to do it? YOU DON'T! YOU ARE ONLY PUNISHING YOURSELF.","83"
"32 The Easy Way to Stop","84","H1"
"It is ridiculously easy
to stop smoking. All you have to do is two things.
1 Make the decision that you are never going to smoke again.
2 Don't rnope about it. Rejoice.","84"
"As I have already said, the whole business of smoking is a subtle, sinister trap. The main problem
of stopping isn't the chemical addiction but the brainwashing, and it was necessary first to explode
the myths and delusions. Understand your enemy. Know his tactics, and you will easily defeat him.","84"
"I then said to myself: ’Allen, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. YOU HAVE SMOKED
YOUR LAST CIGARETTE,'","85"
"It is only when
you want a cigarette but can't have one that you suffer.","85"
"Therefore the key to making it easy is to make stopping certain and final. Not to hope but to know
you have kicked it, having made the decision. Never to doubt or question it. In fact, just the reverse -
always to rejoice about it.
If you tan be certain from the start, it will he easy. But how can you be certain from the start unless
you know it is going to be easy? This is why the rest of the book is necessary. There are certain
essential points and it is necessary to get them clear in your mind before you start.","85"
"1 Realize that you can achieve it. There is nothing different about you, and the only person who
can make you smoke that next cigarette is you.
2 There is absolutely nothing to give up. On the contrary, there are enormous positive gains to be
made, I do not only mean you will be healthier and richer. I mean you will enjoy the good times
more and be less miserable during the bad times.
3 Get it clear in your head that there is no such thing as one cigarette. Smoking is a drug addiction
and a chain re action. By moaning about the odd cigarette you will only be punishing yourself
needlessly.
4 See the whole business of smoking not as a sociable habit that might injure you. but as drug
addiction. Face up to the fact that, whether you like it or not, YOU HAVE GOT THE
DISEASE. It will not go away because you bury your head in the sand. Remember: like
all crippling diseases, it not only lasts for life but gets worse and worse. The easiest time to cure
it is now.
5 Separate the disease (i.e. the chemical addiction) from the frame of mind of being a smoker or a
non-smoker. All smokers, if given the opportunity to go back to the time before they became
hooked, would jump at that opportunity. You have that opportunity today! Don't even think
about it as 'giving up' smoking. When you have made the final decision that you have smoked
your last cigarette you will already be a non-smoker. A smoker is one of those poor wretches
who have to go through life destroying themselves with cigarettes. A non-smoker is someone
who doesn't. Once you have made that final decision, you have already achieved your object.
Rejoice in the fact. Do not it moping waiting for the chemical addiction to go. Get out and","85"
"enjoy life immediately. Life is marvelous even when you are addicted to nicotine, and each day it
will get better when you aren't.","86"
"The key to making it easy to quit smoking is to be certain that you will succeed in abstaining
completely during the withdrawal period (maximum three weeks). If you are in the correct frame of
mind, you will find it ridiculously easy.","86"
"What I am saying is, if you can start right now by saying, 'I am never going to
smoke again. Isn't it marvelous?'","86"
"33 The Withdrawal Period","87","H1"
"For up to three weeks after your last cigarette you may be subjected to withdrawal pangs. These
consist of two quite separate factors.
1 The withdrawal pangs of nicotine, that empty, insecure feeling, like
a hunger, which smokers identify as a craving or something to do
with their hands.
2 The psychological trigger of certain events such as a telephone
conversation.","87"
"Stopping smoking is similar. During the early days of the withdrawal period the trigger mechanism
will operate at certain times. You will think, 'I want a cigarette.' It is essential to counter the
brainwashing right from square one, then these automatic triggers will quickly disappear.","87"
"However, part of the brainwashing remains, and I
think the second most pathetic thing about smoking is the smoker who has given up for health or
money reasons, yet even after several years still craves a cigarette on certain occasions. He is pining
for an illusion that exists only in his mind and is needlessly torturing himself.","87"
"A sugar pill, although giving no actual physical help, can be a powerful psychological aid to relieve
genuine symptoms and is therefore a benefit. The cigarette, however, is not a sugar pill. It creates the
symptoms that it relieves and after a while ceases even to relieve these symptoms completely; the
'pill' is causing the disease, and quite apart from that it also happens to be the No. 1 killer poison in
society.","88"
"It is essential to counter the brainwashing right from the start. Get it quite clear in your head: you
don't need the cigarette, and you are only torturing yourself by continuing to regard it as some sort
of prop or boost. There is no need to be miserable. Cigarettes do not make meals or social occasions;
they ruin them.","88"
"Abandon the concept of the smoking habit as pleasurable in itself, Many smokers think, 'If only
there were a clean cigarette.' There are clean cigarettes. Any smoker who trios herbal cigarettes soon
finds out they are a waste of time. Get it clear in your mind that the only reason you have been
smoking is to get the nicotine. Once you have got rid of the craving for nicotine you will have no
more need to stick a cigarette in your mouth than in your ear.","88"
"Whether the pang is due to actual withdrawal symptoms (the empty feeling) or a trigger
mechanism, accept it. The physical pain is nonexistent and with the right frame of mind cigarettes
become no problem. Do not worry about withdrawal. The feeling itself isn't bad. It is the association
with wanting a cigarette and then feeling denied that is the problem.","88"
"In other words, for the next three weeks you will have a slight trauma inside your body, but during
those weeks, and for the rest of your life, something marvelous will be happening. You will be
ridding yourself of an awful disease. That bonus will more than outweigh the slight trauma, and you
will actually enjoy the withdrawal pangs. They will become moments of pleasure.","88"
"Think of the whole business of stopping as an exciting game. Think of the nicotine monster as a
sort of tape worm inside your stomach. You have got to starve him for three weeks, and he is going to
try to trick you into lighting a cigarette to keep him alive.","88"
"Whatever the temptation, get it into your mind
that it is: only there because of the monster inside your body, and every time you resist the temptation
you have dealt another mortal blow in the battle.","89"
"Whatever you do, don't try to forget about smoking. This is one of the things that causes smokers
using the Willpower Method hours of depression. They try to get through each day hoping that
eventually they'll just forget about it.
It is like not being able to sleep. The more you worry about it, the harder it becomes.","89"
"In any event you won't be able to forget about it. For the first few days the 'little monster' will keep
reminding you, and you won't be able to avoid it; while there are still smokers and extensive cigarette
promotions about, you will have constant reminders.","89"
"The point is, you have no need to forget. Nothing bad is happening. Something marvelous is taking
place. Even if you are thinking about it a thousand times a day, SAVOUR EACH MOMENT.
REMIND YOURSELF HOW MARVELLOUS IT IS TO BE FREE AGAIN. REMIND
YOURSELF OF THE SHEER JOY OF NOT HAVING TO CHOKE YOURSELF ANY MORE.","89"
"As I have said, you will find that the pangs become moments of pleasure, and you will be surprised how
quickly you will then forget about smoking.","89"
"Whatever you do DO NOT DOUBT YOUR DECISION. Once you start to doubt, you will start to
mope, and it will get worse. Instead use the moment as a boost. If the cause is depression, remind
yourself that's what cigarettes were doing to you. If you are offered one by a friend, take pride in
saying, 'I'm happy to say I do not need them any more.' That will hurt him, but when he sees that it
isn't bothering you he will be halfway to joining you.","89"
"Once you start
telling yourself that you don't need to smoke, in a very short time you won't even need to say it
because the beautiful truth is . . . you do not need to smoke. It's the last thing you need to do; make
sure it's not the last thing you do.","89"
"34 Just One Puff","90","H1"
"For most, smokers that first puff doesn't taste good, and this gives their conscious minds a boost. They
think, 'Good. That wasn't enjoyable. I am losing the urge to smoke; In fact, the reverse is the case. Get
it clear in your mind - CIGARETTES NEVER WERE ENJOYABLE. Enjoyment wasn't the reason
why you smoked. If smokers smoked for enjoyment, they'd never smoke more than one cigarette.","90"
"The only reason why you smoked was to feed that little monster. Just think: you had starved him for
four days. How precious that one cigarette or just the puff must have been to him. You are not aware of
it in your conscious mind, but the fix your body received will be communicated to your subconscious
mind and all your sound preparation will be undermined. There will be a little voice at the back of
your mind saying, 'In spite of all the logic, they are precious. I want another one.""","90"
"35 Will it be Harder for Me?","91","H1"
"Again this can be easily overcome if your frame of mind is correct. Do not worry that you are
continually reminded that you have stopped smoking. Use such moments to rejoice in the fact
that you are ridding yourself of the evil monster. If you have a positive frame of mind, these pangs
can become moments of pleasure.","91"
"36 The Main Reasons for Failure","92","H1"
"There are two main reasons for failure. The first is the influence of other smokers. At a weak moment
or during a social occasion somebody will light up. I have already dealt with this topic at length. Use
that moment to remind yourself that there is no such thing as one cigarette. Rejoice in the fact that
you have broken the chain. Remember that the smoker envies you, and feel sorry for him. Believe
me, he needs your pity.","92"
"The other main reason for failure is having a bad day. Get it clear in your mind before you start
that, whether you are a smoker or a non-smoker, there are good days and bad days. Life is a matter of
relativity, and you cannot have ups without having downs.","92"
"If you have a bad day during the withdrawal period, just take it on the chin. Remind yourself that you
had bad days when you smoked (otherwise you wouldn't have decided to stop). Instead of moping
about it, say to yourself something like, 'OK, today's not so good, but smoking is not going to cure it.
Tomorrow will be better, and at least I have got a marvelous bonus at the moment. I have kicked
that awful cigarette habit.'","92"
"37 Substitutes","93","H1"
"Remember: cigarettes create the void; they do not fill it. The quicker you teach your brain that you
do not need to smoke, or do anything else in its place, the sooner you will be free.","93"
"Remember EASYWAY makes it easy to quit immediately. You can kill the big monster
(brainwashing) before you extinguish your final cigarette. The little monster will soon be dead and
even while it is dying, will be no more of a problem than it was when you were a smoker.","93"
"Some say: 'I wouldn't even take the break if I didn't smoke.' That proves the point,
often the break is taken, not because the smoker needs it or even wants it, but because the smoker
desperately needs to scratch the itch.","94"
"Remember, you don't need a substitute. Those pangs are a craving for poison and will soon be gone.
Let that be your prop for the next few days. Enjoy ridding your body of poison and your mind of
slavery and dependence.","94"
"38 Should I Avoid Temptation Situations?","95","H1"
"The second phase of fear is longer-term. It involves the fear that certain situations in the future
will not be enjoyable without a cigarette or that you will not be able to cope with a trauma
without the cigarette. Don't worry. If you can launch yourself you will find the opposite to be
the case.","95"
"'Isn't it marvelous that I do not need to smoke any more?'","96"
"39 The Moment of Revelation","97","H1"
"If ever I am feeling low and need a boost nowadays, I just
think how lovely it is not to be hooked on that awful weed. Half the people who contact me after they
have kicked the weed say exactly the same thing, that it was the most marvelous event of their lives.
Ah! What pleasure you have to come!","97"
"With an additional twelve years' feedback, both from the book and from my consultations, I have
learned that in most cases the moment of revelation occurs not after three weeks, as stated above,
but within a few days.","97"
"40 The Final Cigarette","99","H1"
"If you do get that feeling of 'I want a cigarette' over the next few
days, your brain has a simple choice. It can either interpret that feeling for what it actually is - an
empty insecure feeling started by the first cigarette and perpetuated by every subsequent one,
and say to yourself: YIPPEE I'M A NON-SMOKER!","99"
"Or you can start craving for a cigarette and suffer it for the rest of your life. Just think for a
moment. Wouldn't that be an incredibly stupid thing to do? To say 'I never want to smoke again',
then spend the rest of your life saying 'I'd love a cigarette.'","99"
"You don't have to wait to stop craving cigarettes or
to become a non-smoker. You do it the moment you extinguish that final cigarette, you have cut off
the supply of nicotine: YOU ARE ALREADY A HAPPY NON-SMOKER!!!","100"
"And you will remain a happy non-smoker provided:
1 You never doubt your decision.
2 You don't wait to become a non-smoker. If you do, you will merely be waiting for nothing to
happen, which will create a phobia.
3 You don't try not to think about smoking or wait for the 'moment of revelation' to come. Either
way you will merely create a phobia.
4 You don't use substitutes.
5 You sec all other smokers as they really are and pity them rather than envy them.","100"
"Whenever you think about smoking either during the next few days or the rest of your life, you
think: YIPPEE. I'M A NON-SMOKER!!!","100"
"41 A Final Warning","101","H1"
"I trust that this book will help you to find it relatively easy to stop smoking. But be warned:
smokers who find it easy to stop find it easy to start again,
DO NOT FALL FOR THIS TRAP.
No matter how long you have stopped or how confident you are that you will never become hooked
again, make it a rule of life not to smoke for any reason. Resist the millions of pounds that the tobacco
companies spend on promotion, and remember they are pushing the No. 1 killer drug and poison.
You wouldn't be tempted to try heroin; and cigarettes kill hundreds of thousands more people than
heroin does.","101"
"Remember, that first cigarette will do nothing for you. You will have no withdrawal pangs to
relieve, and it will taste awful. What it will do is to put nicotine into your body, and a little voice at
the back of your mind will be saying, 'You want another one.' Then you have got the choice of being
miserable for a while or starting the whole filthy chain again.","101"
